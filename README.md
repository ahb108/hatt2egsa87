Conversion of Greek HATT to EGSA87
=================

This is an R script for converting vector, points lines and polygons
digitised from old Greek military HATT projection map sheets
to the Greek national grid (the latter being better described via EPSG
etc.).
Ideally this would all have been done for the PROJ4 library, but ran
out of time.
There is an example script in the examples folder, for polygon and
point datasets respectively.
